    Law (four reaped-runner incidents, 2026-09-29/30): by the time handle()
    returns the runner must NOT hang in the caller's process tree. Both killers
    walk pids, not sessions: the gateway-restart process-tree SIGTERM sweep, and
    the process_registry completion sweep (_terminate_host_pid: snapshot
    descendants WHILE the parent lives, SIGTERM parent, per-pid SIGKILL
    escalation over the snapshot, re-scan). start_new_session escapes only
    group-directed signals, never a per-pid kill of a snapshotted descendant.
    The double-fork hop reparents the runner out of the caller's tree before the
    door returns, so no CALLER-TREE sweep can ever snapshot it; children inherit
    the escape through the runner. Claim boundary (#8 review, finding 1):
    double-fork/setsid does NOT change cgroup membership — a sweep that kills by
    cgroup membership (e.g. the unit-cgroup ExecStopPost SIGKILL a gateway
    restart runs) still reaches caller, runner and children alike. Surviving an
    enclosing service/cgroup cleanup is external supervision's job (a mitigation
    outside this diff), not what this hop claims.

    Admission stays the runner-side kernel flock (loser exits WORKFLOW_BUSY
    before touching any state). SOLE-OWNER stamp law (#8 review, findings 3+4):
    the ADMITTED runner is the ONLY writer of wf.pid — it self-stamps right
    after it wins the flock (wf.py acquire_lock -> ready_stamp) and announces
    the same pid on the door's ready pipe. The door NEVER writes wf.pid: an
    observed pid may be returned to the caller, but a post-admission door write
    is a second owner racing the runner — the deep review reproduced both
    failures deterministically (a door parked after observing A let B be
    admitted, then its late write resurrected dead A; a forced refused-fork
    fallback stamped the flock-refused dead loser over the live winner). A
    spawn that never readied is left stamped only by whoever WON the flock; the
    explicit wait-resume law covers a dead spawn and the flock makes any retry
    a harmless loser.

    Append mode: runner.log keeps crash diagnostics across respawns. The
    contextvar profile scope does NOT cross processes: a runner spawned for a run
    under the RESOLVED runs root gets that home stamped explicitly (core's own #18594
    guidance for subprocess spawners), so its seat config and child env follow the
    OWNER's profile, not the launch root os.environ carries on a multiplex host.
    A legacy-location run (pre-fix, under the launch root) keeps the inherited env
    verbatim — runner_alive compares it against the run's parent.
