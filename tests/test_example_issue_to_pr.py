"""issue-to-pr example gate (Core-10 authoring contract).

The template's teaching laws are STRUCTURAL: abort-before-investment only exists
if the halt gates are complementary and every expensive node hangs behind the
work route; the baseline-then-delta law only exists if baseline precedes fix AND
verify declares baseline in inputs; cleanup is only honest if it hangs on BOTH
the publish path and the halt arms. Those are shape facts — assert them here,
cold, without spawning anything. Run directly: prints PASS lines, exits non-zero
on the first broken contract.
