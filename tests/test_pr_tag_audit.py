"""Behavioral tests for scripts/pr_tag_audit.py (the release-side tag-state gate).

Numbered checks map to the reconcile findings (est-4vnq):
  A1-A4  finding 2 — INVERSE direction: an `(open PR #NN)` tag on a row whose
         action IS dispatched (shipped) must FAIL even while that PR is open.
         The old audit checked only PR STATE, so a shipped `run` row tagged
         `(open PR #47)` printed `OK — 8 tagged line(s)` and exited 0 (observed
         red-proof on base f83e5d0: `pr_tag_audit: OK — 8 tagged line(s),
         every referenced PR still open` / exit=0 with PR #47 verified OPEN).
  B1-B2  finding 3 — missing `gh` must exit 2 with file:line tag diagnostics,
         not raise FileNotFoundError and exit 1 (observed red-proof on base:
         uncaught traceback `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or
         directory: 'gh'` / exit=1, stdout empty).
  C1-C3  state machine, exercised with a deterministic fake `gh` (never the
         network): merged -> exit 1 + rewrite owed; closed -> exit 1; all open
         -> exit 0.

The script resolves ROOT from its own file location, so every scenario copies
the minimum file set into a scratch dir and mutates THAT — the tree is never
touched. Stdlib only; no network; gh is only ever the fixture or genuinely
absent (PATH=).
