"""est-06xk (issue #123) — quorum drain-with-deadline.

With an explicit `quorum`, today's runner SIGKILLs every straggler the MOMENT
quorum is met. That throws away useful in-flight work: a straggler one tool-call
from a real answer dies for nothing. This pin locks the opt-in fix:

  fanout.quorum_drain_s (number >= 0, default 0) — legal ONLY alongside
  `quorum`. At the quorum moment the runner arms ONE drain window of drain_s
  seconds; a straggler that lands its answer inside the window COMMITS (the
  drain cancels nothing that arrives before the deadline), and at the deadline
  the SAME _cancel_stragglers runs (error_class 'cancelled', the a2d7f664
  quorum-moment evidence string — i.e. today's kill, just deferred).
  drain_s = 0 is byte-for-byte today's behavior (immediate cancel); the flip
  to a friendlier default later is one constant in wf.py.

Cases:
  D  validator: -1 / "5" / True rejected as fanout.quorum_drain_s; drain
     without quorum rejected; 0 / 1.5 with quorum accepted; the closed-set
     unknown-key message lists the key.
  A  drain_s absent / 0 regression twin: straggler cancelled promptly.
  B  drain_s > 0, straggler lands BEFORE the deadline -> done, zero cancels.
  C  drain_s > 0, straggler still running AT the deadline -> cancelled with
     the quorum-moment evidence, node still commits done on the winner.
  D2 drain only arms at the quorum moment: quorum=2 of 3 — no early kill.
