"""Stub hermes_bin for test_orphan_adopt_790c6ad — the live-orphan repro child.

Prints its pid to $FAKE_LOG (one line per spawn; the test counts lines to
prove NO re-spawn happened), keeps the session title token in its OWN argv
(the runner passes `--continue <skey>#a<n>` — that is the PID-reuse guard the
adoption law verifies), flushes a progress line, then sleeps, then prints the
fenced answer and exits 0 — a child that outlives its runner and finishes on
its own, exactly the waveA3 shape.
