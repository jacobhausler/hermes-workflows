"""est-g255 r3 (zap CHANGES at 81826493, HIGH) — the seat-admission loop must
be bounded THROUGH admit_lock contention, not just through the .lock flock.

Failure (zap probes: stamp-queue-r3/parent-admit-lock-probes.json): the
admit_lock acquisition in _seat_acquire is a bare `with al_cm:` — a plain
Lock.acquire() with NO deadline/abort checks. A contended admit_lock (the
fan-out's results lock, held by sibling threads throughout survivor book-
keeping) makes a waiter with bounded_s=0.05 return only after the holder's
0.6504s release, and a waiter whose abort was set at 0.08s return only after
0.6500s. The bounded/cancellable contract dies at the mutex.

Fix contract (wf.py): admit_lock is taken with a TIMEOUT acquisition in a
loop that rechecks the same deadline/abort predicate between tries; on
timeout-while-out() it returns None (no ticket — the same contract as the
flock path); after acquiring, _out() is rechecked UNDER the lock before any
ticket is written, and the lock is released in a finally. The atomicity that
the mutex provides is preserved exactly: the cancel-setter synchronizes on
admit_lock BEFORE setting its Event, and the holder rechecks abort() under
the mutex.

Cases (run under empty HERMES_HOME + isolated WF_RUNS_ROOT):
  A) contended admit_lock + finite bounded_s: the waiter must give up on its
     OWN deadline — elapsed << the holder's release delay, zero tickets.
  B) contended admit_lock + abort set mid-block: same — bounded return well
     before the holder releases, zero tickets.
  C) control: uncontended admit_lock still admits (a fresh ticket exists).
  D) control: cancel-under-mutex atomicity — a setter that synchronizes on
     admit_lock before setting abort must, scanning under the mutex, either
     SEE the holder's ticket or the waiter must deny the ticket; it can never
     miss a ticket that was actually created.
