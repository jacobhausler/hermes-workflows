"""est-g255 r2 R3 (zap CHANGES at 1233d3fd, MED) — EVERY step after a
successful Popen, INCLUDING the meta['_procs'] registry insertion and the
heartbeat-path setup, must sit inside the one cleanup owner: a fault there
leaves NO orphan child and NO retained ticket.

Failure (zap r2 probes-repo.json / registration-runtime + registration-oserror +
heartbeat-setup): fault-injecting at the post-Popen registry insert or the
heartbeat-sidecar setup escaped the kill/reap/release owner with a live
immediate child AND a held seat ticket (the immediate-child gap also reproduces
at the matched base; the PERSISTENT ticket retention is PR-added relative to
that base — the fix must remove the leak the PR introduced and pull both
seams under the same boundary).

Fix contract (wf.py): once Popen succeeds, any exception at registration,
heartbeat setup, or any later setup step kills + reaps the immediate child,
unregisters, releases the seat ticket, closes the log fd — then surfaces the
fault (the typed launcher-spawn return is preserved ONLY for a Popen that
never happened).

Proof of Popen per case: the injected registry seam observes the Popen object
the product tries to register (its pid), so the control provably reached the
post-Popen side even when the child is killed before it writes any FAKE_LOG
line.
