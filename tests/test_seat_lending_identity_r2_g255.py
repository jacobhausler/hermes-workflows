"""est-g255 r2 R2 (zap CHANGES at 1233d3fd, HIGH) — ancestor lending must
require the child occupant's IDENTITY, not bare PID ancestry membership.

Failure (zap r2 probes-repo.json / contradicted-lending): a ticket whose child
pid sits in this process's ancestor chain is LENT (exempt from the cap) even
when the pinned child identity is CONTRADICTED (child_boottime disagrees with
the live occupant's start tick) — a live runner holder keeps the ticket
occupied, so the stale child pin must not buy the exemption. The crafted row
{pid: live runner, child: <live ancestor pid>, child_boottime: -1} admitted a
second seat at cap=1 while the occupied ticket remained.

Fix contract (wf.py): the lending exemption at _seat_live_tickets requires the
SAME child occupant to be proven live — _seat_holder_live(child, child_boottime)
(#80 occupant identity: pid liveness plus kernel start-tick equality). A
contradicted (recycled) child identity = no lend; the ticket counts. A legibly
proven child still lends (no over-refusal), and a legacy unpinned child row is
not disproved by this gate (same never-disprove law as the holder check).
