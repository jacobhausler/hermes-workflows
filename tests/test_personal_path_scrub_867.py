"""est-2ek.1.867 — the publish audit must SEE personal absolute paths (R9 gap).

The shape this pins: a shipped test module carried an unnecessary incident
narrative containing a real personal home path; the merged scrub audit
(scripts/make_public.py + scripts/scrub-list.txt) reported zero hits while the
prose survived BOTH the public export and the built source ZIP. A green scrub
was not sufficient evidence for R9: the audit simply had no personal-path
category. Two parts, standalone (no pytest), house style:

1. DETECTION (fixture repo): a shipped test file carrying a personal
   home-path incident narrative makes scripts/make_public.py's OWN audit exit
   nonzero — the category exists, and no guard silences it.
2. CLEANLINESS (this repo): the real export build passes, and the packed
   source ZIP (scripts/pack.py) contains ZERO personal-path hits in any
   member — the ZIP is audited with the same regex the export audit uses,
   independently of the guard list, because pack.py has never run the audit
   at all (the second half of the shipped-byte gap).
