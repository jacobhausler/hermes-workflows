"""5c37b19 — deleted-cwd runner killers (fb 5c37b19109179eab, run 20260926-061429).

One family: the runner must DEGRADE, not die ENOENT, when a directory it writes
to is gone mid-flight.
 1. _resume_preamble survives a deleted runner cwd (guard 1 — the bare
    Path.cwd() killer on the bounded-retry re-drive; the solo path has no worker
    try/except, so pre-fix the raise escaped run_agent_node, passed the loop's
    ex.map and died in the __main__ BaseException net: runner_exit
    'crashed: FileNotFoundError').
 2. End-to-end shape of that death: solo agent node dies once transport-with-
    tool-progress (fake 'retry_progress'), the runner's cwd is rmdir'd DURING
    the 5 s bounded-retry backoff — the re-drive's _resume_preamble runs with a
    live-deleted cwd. Post-fix the runner survives (rc 0) and the re-drive
    lands. Per the check's refutation the node assertion is done-or-failed
    (run_agent_node never raises); the hard assertions are runner-survival and
    no 'crashed: FileNotFoundError'.
 3. __main__ startup self-recovery (guard 2): launched FROM a deleted dir, the
    runner chdirs to HERE (durable — the dir __init__.py pins as the spawn cwd)
    and reaches its normal verdict instead of dying with FileNotFoundError.
 4. THE OBSERVED KILLER (run 20260926-061429 runner.log): the when-skip write
    into a gates/ subtree deleted mid-loop. Deterministic shape: a seeded-answer
    human gate short-circuits the hold, the loop reaches the when-false skip
    while a patched when_true rmtree's <run>/gates at the exact moment — pre-fix
    FileNotFoundError killed loop() -> main() -> the runner; the mkdir-before-
    write fix recreates gates/ + gates/<id>.json and the run closes done.
