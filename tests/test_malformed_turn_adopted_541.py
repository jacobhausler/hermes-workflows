"""est-2ek.1.541 R8 — the malformed-turn CLASSIFICATION LAW is path-invariant.

Deep-review finding (R8, verified with real-runner evidence): the fresh-head rc!=0
path typed the serialized-tool-call reply `malformed_turn` and re-drove it, while
the ADOPTED-death path (the runner was respawned and adopted the still-live child;
rc unobservable) classified the identical reply `unknown` — sibling coverage was
incomplete, so the same death produced two different classes depending on which
path reached it.

Law pinned here: the SAME reply, driven through the REAL runner on BOTH paths
(fresh spawn vs adopted live orphan), must commit the SAME error_class
(`malformed_turn`, closed-set member) and the verbatim tool-call-as-text
diagnostic. The bounded ladder may or may not re-drive (the adopted attempt's
spend is already committed) — the CLASS never varies.

Mechanics mirror the field harness: spawn tests/fake (toolcall_text_541, rc=1)
OUTSIDE the runner as a verified live orphan (start_new_session, registered via
wf.write_spawn_record + wfcommon.active_child proof), then run the real runner —
it must ADOPT rather than re-spawn, the child then dies with the markup, and the
node record must carry the class. Positive tool-progress is written by the fake's
mode itself (the same evidence the bounded gate reads).

Red-proof (run before the fix): adopted path committed error_class='unknown'
with one invocation; fresh path 'malformed_turn' with two. Green: both
'malformed_turn'.
