"""00e46adb (spool 5ff2806f359c16a1): a fresh verify node two hops under a go-gate
could not see the gate's committed answer — the binding release ("proceed despite C1,
owner override …") reached only the gate's DIRECT child via the auto parent-injection
loop, so the verify graded the deliberate override as 'C1 NOT met / authority
UNVERIFIED'. Law (build_inputs): every transitive ancestor gate whose answer is
COMMITTED (done via the gate_answer_valid efp law) is injected into every downstream
agent prompt, capped like any auto input; a skipped/unanswered gate has no done
record and injects NOTHING (fail-closed by construction); ids already covered by an
explicit `inputs:` ref or a direct-parent block are never duplicated. Solo graphs
with no released gate gain zero bytes (golden-solo EMPTY is the outer gate).
