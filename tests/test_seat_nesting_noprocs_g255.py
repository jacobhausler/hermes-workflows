"""est-g255 P255-5 (zap, MED) — nested-ticket lending depends entirely on
Linux /proc; on a no-procfs platform the ancestor set is silently empty and a
nested admission deadlocks to the seat_wait expiry instead of lending.

Base failure (zap independent-results.json / no_procfs_nested_admission): with
only /proc reads made absent, the same held ancestor-shaped ticket Linux
excludes (count=0) was counted by the waiter, cap=1 nested admission expired.
_proc_alive has a ps fallback; _ancestors has NONE. Native Darwin was not
available and is not claimed tested — so the contract this test pins is the
OTHER allowed answer zap accepted: prove nesting WITHOUT /proc (ps ppid
fallback), and where NO identity channel exists, REFUSE typed with a clear
error class instead of silently deadlocking.
