"""est-2ek.1.857 — the seat semaphore must never drop a LIVE ticket, and never
admit past the cap (over-admit ~2x field report).

Failure (field report 2026-10-08 12:45–12:48Z, spool key 248a5bf33fe5999a,
evidence recorded locally as seat-overadmit-20261008T1248Z):
8–9 live workflow agent children vs 4 tickets in ~/.hermes/workflows/.seats
(cap 4). Three children had NO ticket while their runner and the child were
both alive; the surviving tickets were always a same-second batch of four,
i.e. something dropped LIVE tickets wholesale and four waiters re-admitted at
once. The ticket count protecting the pinned model server was void.

Two base-code gaps this contract closes:

 (B1) prune is single-shot: `_seat_live_tickets` unlinks a ticket the FIRST
      time every holder fails `_seat_holder_live`. One transiently-wrong death
      verdict (an ESRCH/Z-state sample that does not repeat) deletes capacity
      that is in use — an unconfirmed verdict must never be load-bearing.
      Fix contract: before unlinking, RECONFIRM the death verdict for every
      holder (re-run the same liveness law after a short settle); any holder
      that reconfirms alive keeps its ticket AND counts as live (unknown is
      never undercounted).

 (B2) the prune of another holder's ticket is silent — the next incident is
      again invisible. Fix contract: every external-ticket unlink appends one
      line to the seats-dir ledger `.pruned.jsonl` (ts, pruner pid, reason,
      ticket row snapshot): loud, never silent.

 (B3) the ask verbatim — an ENGINE-level invariant under concurrent runners:
      at every sample while agents hold seats, the set of live tickets equals
      the set of live fake agent children (each ticket names a live bound
      child, every live child is named by exactly one ticket); killing one
      holder's child and letting the blocked third runner in preserves the
      invariant. This test is green-by-construction at head; it exists so a
      future ticket-drop path fails loudly instead of shipping.
