"""#71 (r5): the in-process door-writer isolation mechanism — a resolver-level pin.

`WF_RUNS_ROOT` alone is NOT a sandbox. The resolver's precedence (#42 — owner design
for real users, deliberately UNCHANGED here) is:

    settings.runs_root  >  WF_RUNS_ROOT env  >  <hermes_home>/workflows

`WF_RUNS_ROOT` outranks only the home-derived DEFAULT — it does NOT outrank an
owner-configured `plugins.entries.hermes-workflows.settings.runs_root`. A lane
process carries core's context-local home override (`set_hermes_home_override`,
invisible to `os.environ`), so a ctx-less door raw-reads the ESTATE profile's
config.yaml; when that file carries the owner setting, every write goes THROUGH
the env pin into the owner's real library — and the test still prints ALL PASS.

A writer is sandboxed only when BOTH doors resolve to the same scratch root:

  * `WF_RUNS_ROOT` — the env pin (already in every writer test);
  * the plugin's `settings.runs_root` — neutralised here at the RESOLVER, not the
    ctx. The door publishes its owner-settings reader (`_owner_setting_read`) into
    wfcommon via `set_owner_setting_reader`; install() wraps THAT function,
    intercepting ONLY the `runs_root` lookup: it answers the CURRENT
    `os.environ["WF_RUNS_ROOT"]` lazily at call time (so the two pins can never
    drift), and when the env pin is unset every key — `runs_root` included — rides
    through to the untouched original reader, i.e. exactly today's raw config.yaml
    fallback answer.

Why the resolver and not `door._CTX`: the door guards its ctx call sites on
truthiness (`if not _CTX: return NO_READER` in `_owner_setting_read`;
`_CTX.get_config("models", {}) if _CTX else {}` in `model_tiers`). A truthy
placeholder ctx flips EVERY ctx-less site into get_config calls and leaks the
NO_READER sentinel into model code (`'object' has no attribute 'items'`). The
resolver wrap leaves `_CTX` — and every ctx-less truthiness path — byte-identical
to an untouched door, and a later `_CTX = …` reassignment still takes full effect
(the original reader reads the module global at call time). Stdlib-only.

Usage, directly after the door module is exec'd:

    import wf_test_isolation as _iso71
    _iso71.install(door)

For a door exec'd inside a SUBPROCESS source string whose env already pins
WF_RUNS_ROOT (claim/team children, tool-bridge probes), bootstrap this file by
explicit path in the child — `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(..., ROOT /
"tests" / "wf_test_isolation.py")` — then call `install(door)` on the child's
door. The S3 audit is text-based, so a string-embedded door counts as a writer
and its pin must live inside that string.
