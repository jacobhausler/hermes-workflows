"""SystemExit must never reach the crash net (phantom 'crashed: SystemExit: 0').

The runner's benign, self-reported exits — acquire_lock()'s lock-loser
sys.exit(0) after WORKFLOW_BUSY, and the no-graph sys.exit(2) — are BaseExceptions.
The last-resort net in the __main__ block (and main()'s own net around loop())
used to record them as "crashed: SystemExit: N" into runner_exit.json. Downstream,
`workflow status/wait` then renders status=failed + next:[amend] WHILE the real
runner and all its children are alive — and the operator reflex that invites
(rerun `wf.py run`, or `amend`) re-stamps or poisons the live run.

This test mirrors the live repro: hold the run's flock to emulate a working
runner, launch a second runner against it, and assert the second runner exits
clean WITHOUT touching the run's exit record. Also asserts the no-graph path
keeps its own honest stamp (rc=2; the net's same-process write was already a
no-op via write_runner_exit's first-writer-wins flag), and that a genuine
crash still reaches the net and stamps.
