"""est-ulwpg — runner spawn ENOENT: <run>/work/<node> deleted between wd capture
and Popen must not be a 100% typed spawn death (witness 20261009-072611-fb-closeout-batch).

Witness receipt (nodes/triage.json): status=failed, error_class=spawn, ms=0,
attempts=1, "launcher spawn failed: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'<run>/work/triage'" — the run dir NEVER had a work/ subtree, events show a
34-min seat.wait between node.started and node.failed, so the deleater struck
in the window between the wd capture (run_child, `wd = str(child_work_dir(...))`
BEFORE _seat_acquire) and the launch-instant Popen (inside the _procs_lock
section). The typed death gave the batch zero retries.

Fix contract (wf.py):
  (a) the spawn seam re-ensures the child cwd IMMEDIATELY before
      subprocess.Popen — call child_work_dir(run, node, index) again inside the
      _procs_lock section (mkdir parents=True, exist_ok=True is idempotent) —
      so an external deleter that prunes <run>/work/<node> during the seat
      wait can no longer outrun the snapshot;
  (b) if Popen STILL raises OSError ENOENT whose filename is the cwd, the seam
      re-creates wd once and retries the Popen exactly once, in the same lock
      section, before declaring error_class=spawn;
  (c) an ENOENT about ANYTHING ELSE (missing hermes_bin -> filename==argv[0])
      keeps failing typed — the retry must not paper over other ENOENTs.

RED on base: leg A dies with error_class=spawn ms=0 (the witness shape), leg
B's first Popen ENOENT escapes as the same typed death, leg C stays green on
both (the guard).
