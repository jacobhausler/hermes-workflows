"""est-g255 P255-2 (zap, HIGH) — the advertised BOUNDED seat wait is unbounded
while blocked in flock, and admits after the deadline / abort.

Base failure (zap independent-results.json / lock_contention_timeout_and_abort):
an isolated lock holder slept 1.3 s on <seats>/.lock; a waiter with bounded_s
0.15 and abort=True nevertheless ADMITTED at 1.304 s — flock LOCK_EX blocks
before either predicate is checked, so a stuck lock holder defeats the node
wall and the stop path.

Fix contract (wf.py): deadline-aware, cancellable admission — non-blocking
LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB poll loop with the deadline honoured BETWEEN attempts, plus a
deadline/abort recheck AFTER acquisition and immediately BEFORE ticket
creation; a refused acquire leaves no ticket behind.

Run: HERMES_HOME=$(mktemp -d) PYTHONPATH=/opt/hermes python3 tests/test_seat_admission_deadline_g255.py
