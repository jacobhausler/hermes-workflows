"""est-g255 r2 R1 (zap CHANGES at 1233d3fd, HIGH) — a quorum cancel that lands
DURING pre-spawn survivor work must still prevent Popen.

Failure (zap r2 probes-repo.json / quorum-during-sidecar): fo_cancel can be set
AFTER the atomic pre-Popen _cancelled() check — e.g. during the survivor
inspection/reaping window — yet Popen still launches a real child. The cancel
setter is not coordinated with the admission/spawn critical section, so the
"never spawn under cancellation" contract has a window between check and launch.

Fix contract (wf.py): the fan-out wires its results lock (which the quorum
setter _cancel_stragglers already holds BEFORE fo_cancel.set()) into
_seat_acquire as admit_lock; _seat_acquire takes admit_lock -> .lock flock and
RECHECKS the abort predicate under both, ATOMICALLY with ticket creation. A
cancel landing before that recheck can never yield a ticket, hence never a
Popen.

Controls (run under empty HERMES_HOME + isolated WF_RUNS_ROOT):
  A) the admission seam: a cancel that becomes visible after the FIRST abort
     check must deny the ticket at the creation instant — zero tickets written.
  B) the spawn seam end-to-end: a cancel landing between the cancel-check
     round-trip and the launch must prevent the spawn — zero children.
  C) control: with NO cancel, admission proceeds (the gate is not a blanket no).
