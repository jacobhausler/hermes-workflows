"""#8 (P0, remaining half): the admitted runner registers its spawn tree in
<run>/spawn-ledger.jsonl so an EXTERNAL reaper can see what a workflow child is.

Issue item 1's observable half: runner + children vanish under an out-of-band
process sweep because nothing legible says "this pid is a workflow runner /
workflow child — reapers must not kill it". The plugin cannot change core's
process_registry (outside this repo); it CAN make the tree legible: every
admitted runner appends a `role:runner` row right after its own ready_stamp
(SOLE-OWNER stamp law — the door never writes ownership, so the door writes
this file NEVER), every spawn-recorded child appends a `role:child` row
(node/index/skey/pid), and each child's judgment closes it with `role:child_end`.

Rows: {ts, pid, role: runner|child|child_end, node, index, skey, purpose:
'workflow-runner'}. Append-only, best-effort: a ledger failure never touches a
spawn (same never-fatal law as the reaper's log match).

RED on origin/main: the file is never written — every check below that reads
spawn-ledger.jsonl fails (missing file / no rows).
