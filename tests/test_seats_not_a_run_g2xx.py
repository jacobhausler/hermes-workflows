"""est-g2xx follow-up — the global seat-ticket dir <runs_root>/.seats is NEVER a run.

The seat semaphore (test_seat_live_g2xx.py) keeps its tickets under
<runs_root>/.seats. Every runs-root enumeration — the door's `list`, the
dashboard read model, the card-enforcement outstanding scan — must skip it (and
any other dot-dir) by construction, through ONE shared helper
(wfcommon.iter_run_dirs), not by the accident that .seats happens to lack a
graph.json today. The adversarial case below plants a graph.json INSIDE .seats:
a name-blind enumeration would list it as a run.

est-g255 P255-6 (zap): the enumeration of the dashboard and the card scan is
asserted BEHAVIOURALLY (each read model is driven against the same adversarial
fixture and its own answer is inspected) — no test reads product source text or
pins helper spelling (CONTRIBUTING R6). The helper contract stays pinned
directly against wfcommon.iter_run_dirs (that IS the helper's behaviour), and
the adversarial planted-run door test is kept verbatim in spirit.
