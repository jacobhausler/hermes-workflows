"""The dashboard reports its MEASURED executed count, INCLUDING a measured zero.

wfcommon.run_summary's declared contract distinguishes a SUPPLIED count
(runs inside `counts`, even 0) from an omitted argument (key absent). The
dashboard's census always measures, so it always supplies (est-7ps8).

Cases (all through an isolated REAL _list_runs() invocation — fresh private
WF_RUNS_ROOT per process, no shared root):

  (A) ZERO valid never-executed runs: the all-zero census keeps its measured
      zero — counts["executed"] == 0 (key PRESENT). Base answer: absent.
  (B) ONE valid never-executed run: counts == {"running":0,"pending":1,
      "executed":0}. Base answer: no executed key.
  (C) Helper controls on the same row shape, pinning the declared
      supplied-versus-unmeasured distinction itself:
        run_summary(rows, executed=0)  -> counts["executed"] == 0 (present)
        run_summary(rows)              -> "executed" NOT in counts

Red discipline: (A) and (B) are rc=1 at base b413983 (the `or None` dropped
the key) and rc=0 at the repair head. (C) is the contract control — green at
both, and the reason (A)/(B) are meaningful.

Run: PYTHONPATH=/opt/hermes:.. python3 tests/test_measured_zero_7ps8.py
(from the tests/ cwd; a fresh private WF_RUNS_ROOT is created per invocation
and any inherited WF_RUNS_ROOT is scrubbed, so a hostile lane env cannot steer
the census nor be written by it — the probe is read-only.)
