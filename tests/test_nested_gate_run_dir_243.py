"""PR #243 BLOCKING-fix contract (zap review comment 6017431934): a machine gate's
probe is bound to the run that OWNS the gate — never to an ancestor's run dir.

A child runner can be spawned by an agent of an ANCESTOR run (door spawns pass
os.environ through, __init__.py). Agent spawns bake HERMES_WF_RUN_DIR to their
own run (wf.py agent-spawn law), but the machine-gate probe spawn historically
inherited the runner's raw environment — so a nested await-ci-style probe that
prefers HERMES_WF_RUN_DIR read its ANCESTOR's handoff pointer.

Zap's repro, executed here against the SHIPPED await-ci argv (the shipped bytes,
not a paraphrase): child's own pointer is `exit 1` and the ancestor's is
`exit 0`. A real isolated `wf.py run` of a gate-only child graph, with the
inherited parent env, must FAIL on the child's own red CI (last_exit 1) — never
release at attempt 1 with the ancestor's last_exit 0. The mirror case (child
green, ancestor red) must RELEASE: the gate follows the child, not the env.
