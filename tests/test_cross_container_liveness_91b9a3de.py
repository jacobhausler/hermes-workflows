"""91b9a3de (recurrence of baa0088f19452326): cross-container runner liveness.
The fleet runs runners in a sibling container on the SHARED ~/.hermes volume with a
separate pid namespace — os.kill(pid, 0) there reads a LIVE runner as dead, and the
door's next=wait / respawn guards then spawn a second runner over live children (the
fb-squad-c false-'interrupted' incident). The kernel-enforced flock on <run>/runner.lock
is the ownership proof that survives pid namespaces: HELD => live, at every call site
through the ONE shared predicate wfcommon.runner_alive. Inertness is equally pinned:
free lock + dead/foreign pid reads dead exactly as before (the pid-identity law runs
verbatim as the fallback), and the fan-out ADOPTION path (wfcommon._verify_spawn_rec,
the 'same pid-only pattern' at the old :966) is deliberately NOT relaxed — adoption
runs inside the spawning runner's own container, where the pid/skey proof is verifiable;
cross-namespace adoption without identity proof would gut the skey-in-cmdline
PID-reuse guard. That is why fixing the runner-level law is safe and adoption stays.
