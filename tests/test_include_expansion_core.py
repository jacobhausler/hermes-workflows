"""expand_includes / include_provenance core-resolver contracts (design
2026-09-30). Pure-Python, hermes-free: a dict library_reader is
injected, the door is never imported. Pins:
  (1) deterministic alias__id namespacing; ID_OK/64-cap REFUSE (never truncate),
      no dots in generated ids.
  (2) the five id-ref surfaces rewritten inside the subtree IN LOCKSTEP: after,
      inputs heads, requires keys, fanout.items_from head + its after entry, and
      when out.<id>. paths — with when heads existence-checked by the resolver
      itself (the validator never checks them).
  (3) nested includes expand inner-first (A -> B -> C), strip-on-expand is a byte
      guarantee, and a graph without includes passes through untouched.
  (4) every guard REFUSES with a named ValueError: missing/unknown entry, cycle,
      alias collision, id collision, depth cap, merged node/byte caps, unbound
      seed, exports misnaming.
  (5) exports map public names -> namespaced ids at parent ref sites; literal
      alias__id refs work without exports; BARE inner ids in the parent REFUSE.
  (6) seed rendering is scoped: {run.KEY} inside the included subtree only — the
      parent's refs are never consumed by include seeds and vice versa.
  (7) shared fixed-scratch-path detection emits notes[] (warn, never rewrite).
  (8) efp stability: a parent node untouched by expansion keeps its def_hash/efp
      byte-for-byte; a rewired node's fingerprint moves (the intended granularity).
