"""#58 (door/sibling-root scan for status+wait): a LIVE run must never answer
`unknown run_id` just because the consumer's env resolves a different home.

Issue shape (quartermaster's graph-admission walk, 2026-09-30): dispatch via the
door under HERMES_HOME=profiles/<seat> (the run lands profile-root), then `wait`
from a process whose env resolves the SHARED root -> `unknown run_id` while the
run dir and its events.jsonl are demonstrably alive next door. find_run covers
resolved-root + legacy launch root only; a profile-scoped consumer sees neither.

Fix contract being pinned (issue #58):
  1. status/wait scan the sibling known roots (estate shared root + every
     profile root under the same Hermes root) BEFORE answering unknown, and
     answer from the hit with a `resolved_via` warning field;
  2. READ paths only — write verbs (amend/release/steer/stop) stay fail-closed
     on the resolved root;
  3. a sibling-resolved wait never spawns a runner from the foreign root;
  4. same-root behavior byte-identical: no resolved_via field, unknown stays
     unknown for a run that exists nowhere.
