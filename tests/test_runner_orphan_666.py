"""est-2ek.1.666 — a terminating runner must never orphan its agent-node child.

Witnessed shape (2026-10-04 15:32Z, fb-closeout): runner terminated (SIGTERM /
SIGKILL-tested paths / crash) -> the current agent-node child survives in its
own session and keeps mutating real state unsupervised.

Law pinned here (RED on base, GREEN on branch):
  T1  SIGTERM the runner mid-child: the child AND its setsid-detached
      grandchild are dead within the grace window and the grandchild's
      heartbeat file STOPS ADVANCING (the orphan-mutates-real-state shape).
  T2  SIGKILL the runner mid-child (no handler can run): the belt-braces fire —
      a cooperating child that notices its runner died self-exits non-zero;
      the detached grandchild's heartbeat stops.
  T3  the seam exists: spawn pins the runner pid into the child env
      (wf.RUNNER_PID_ENV), the child-side helper is wf.child_parent_watch, and
      the runner registers termination cleanup (killpg on every exit path).
  T4  the belt's lane probe confirms a held runner.lock: a PEER belt's µs
      probe flock is never misread as a replacement runner (CI red 37265560243
      — one misread reset the grace and T2's orphan outlived the window); a
      real holder still reads live (adoption law kept).

The grandchild heartbeats to FAKE_HB_666 every 0.2 s (stub_orphan_666_child.py),
detached double-fork+setsid so the child group's killpg alone cannot reach it.
