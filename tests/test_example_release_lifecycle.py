"""release-lifecycle example gate (Core-10 authoring contract).

The template's teaching laws are STRUCTURAL: the halt decision and the drift
decision must each be a complementary prune-gate pair; the publish arm must sit
behind the green machine check AND a human gate; the await-ci gate must be a
machine park whose argv is FIXED (a seed must not be able to smuggle shell into
a process argument); the publication fan-out must be a barrier (no quorum) whose
intake head sits in its own after (prune law). Assert cold, no spawns. Run
directly: prints PASS lines, exits non-zero on the first broken contract.
