"""est-2ek.1.62 - validate() names the fuzzy sibling-key rename on missing-required
so the typed-correction retry CONVERGES instead of re-emitting the same shape.

Repro class (from the report): a node whose JSON was complete and correct FAILED schema
because it used sibling key names (mean_ranking vs mean_rank). The engine's
only feedback was the bare "missing required \'<r>\'" (wf.py:1017 at the base
SHA), so the -Q child re-emitted the same shape and the node died
error_class=schema.

Observable contract (plan spec):
  * when the object carries EXTRA keys the schema doesn't name, and one is
    close to the missing required name, the error names the rename explicitly:
    "missing required 'id' (you wrote 'proposal'? the schema needs 'id')"
    (the plan's own worked example - a pure difflib ratio never fires for the
    id/proposal pair, ratio 0.0, so the closeness rule adds containment: a
    short required name that is a substring of the extra key; get_close_matches
    n=1 cutoff 0.6 covers the mean_rank/mean_ranking class);
  * the SAME error string flows verbatim into the existing typed-correction
    retry prompt - no new retry or spawn-path edit;
  * non-suggestion error strings stay BYTE-IDENTICAL to today's form:
    missing with unrelated extras => unchanged; no extras => unchanged;
  * type-consistency guard: a close-name whose value type CONTRADICTS the
    required property's declared type gets NO suggestion - never recommend a
    rename that would still fail the type check. When the schema declares no
    type for the required property, any sibling value is consistent.

Pure-function test: no spawn, no network, stdlib only (R4). validate()-only
change - callers (spawn sites, _harvest_cancelled) pass the strings through.
