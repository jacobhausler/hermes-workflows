"""census-fanout example gate (Core-10 authoring contract).

The template's teaching law is a DETERMINISTIC TALLY: every dispatched item is
answered or NAMED missing, computed from the machine record — never from prose.
That law is only real if the graph structure makes it enforced, so this stdlib
script asserts the shape that makes it so (the PR #108 cold-reader lesson:
synth/judge nodes must DECLARE inputs + a schema and must READ all_results —
never recite a baked-in roster). Run directly: prints PASS lines, exits non-zero
on the first broken contract.
