"""#8 (review findings 3+4, P1): the ADMITTED runner is the SOLE wf.pid owner.

Stamp law: the runner self-stamps wf.pid inside ready_stamp() immediately AFTER
it has won the runner-side flock (wf.py: acquire_lock -> ready_stamp). The door
must never write wf.pid at all — its post-observation write-back is wrong on
both schedules the deep review reproduced (comment 5914319654):

  W1 — ready-pipe second write (__init__.py _spawn_runner, the `if pid is not
       None: (r / "wf.pid").write_text(...)` tail): the door keeps the pid it
       observed on the ready pipe and writes it LATER — other work can run in
       between, a replacement runner can be admitted into the same run, and the
       late write resurrects the dead pid. Deterministic seam: pause door A
       right after _ready_pid observed admitted runner A; let A die and release
       the flock; admit runner B for the same run; only THEN release door A —
       buggy head leaves wf.pid naming dead A while live B holds the flock.

  W2 — refused-fork fallback (intermediate exits 3 -> _spawn_runner_legacy
       direct spawn): with a live winner holding the flock, the legacy child is
       flock-refused (WORKFLOW_BUSY) yet the door stamps its dead pid. Reviewer
       probe: winner 289668 live, dead loser 289683 ended up in wf.pid.

Returning an observed pid to the caller is fine — REWRITING wf.pid is not (the
legacy path needs no door stamp either: there the Popen'd child IS the runner
and self-stamps at admission exactly like the daemonized path).

The estate shelf is never touched: HERMES_HOME and WF_RUNS_ROOT are BOTH
sandboxed into tests/home-wfpidowner8/ via os.environ before import.
