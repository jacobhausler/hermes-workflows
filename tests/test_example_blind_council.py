"""Core-10 #89 review blocker: the EFFECTIVE synthesis prompt must not carry the
seat-only blindness prohibition.

The door bakes defaults.context ONTO every agent's own context (apply_graph_defaults
is an addition, not an override). A prohibition phrased for reviewers that lives in
defaults.context therefore reaches the synthesis seat too — which is REQUIRED to
merge and attribute the seat payloads — and the effective prompt contradicts itself.
Checking the raw `synthesis.context` field alone misses this (round-1 near-miss).

Regression law: seat-only rules live in per-seat `context`; defaults.context carries
only grounding rules every seat AND synthesis can obey. Asserted on the BAKED graph.
