"""Stub hermes_bin for test_runner_orphan_666 — the runner-death-orphan repro child.

The witnessed shape (est-2ek.1.666, fb-closeout 2026-10-04 15:32Z): a terminating
runner leaves its agent-node child running unsupervised. This stub reproduces it
faithfully: it prints a progress line (never a silent spawn), detaches a
grandchild into its OWN session (double-fork + setsid — the escape shape the
killpg of the child's group cannot reach), and the grandchild APPENDS a
heartbeat line every 0.2 s while it lives.

The child-side belt (est-2ek.1.666): BOTH the agent child and its detached
grandchild run wf.child_parent_watch() — they self-exit non-zero the instant
their runner is verifiably gone and no replacement runner holds the lane.
On base the helper does not exist: the belt is a no-op, the heartbeat advances
forever, and the test is RED. That is the point. (wf is imported ONCE, before
any thread/fork — the forked grandchild uses the inherited reference; forking
while another thread imports can hand the child a held import lock.)
