"""est-xwvu9: the shipped/catalog build must not carry the post_exit_hook mechanism.

Upstream hermes-agent PR #133387 review 5467148429 asked for the launchctl
post-exit node-script registration (a4dbd51 / #261 nightly-#261 mechanism) to
be stripped from anything we ship; we publicly accepted the ask in reply
6079245885. This is the RED->GREEN strip gate:
  (a) post_exit_hook.py is absent from the shipped tree AND from the release ZIP,
  (b) wf.py carries no post_exit_hook reference at all,
  (c) the dispatch block (dispatch + post_exit_handoff sweep) is gone.
