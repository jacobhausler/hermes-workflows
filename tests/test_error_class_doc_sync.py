"""Doc-side closed-set pin: AGENTS.md §3d must name EXACTLY wf.ERROR_CLASSES.

The est-vb65 lesson, one notch further. A previous pin made the frozenset
exhaustive over COMMITTED classes (a class whose code path a fake never walks
could not go unlisted); that pin lives in tests/test_error_classes_exhaustive_vb65.py.
But AGENTS.md §3d cites its backtick pipe-list as *the* closed set every
`node.failed` carries, and nothing pinned THAT to the code — adding a class to
the frozenset while forgetting the doc was buyable (observed at head e505158:
`malformed_turn` in code, zero doc hits outside generated files). This pin
closes the doc half of the same drift class: a rename or addition that does
not update the doc fails the build.

`unknown` is exempted from the pipe-list deliberately — §3d carries it in the
following prose as the harvest-time default, not in the pipe-list — so the
law asserted is: pipe-list ∪ {unknown} == ERROR_CLASSES, exactly, both ways.

grammar.md is NOT pinned: its only 'closed set' sentence is the fanout-key
law, and it has no error-class enumeration to drift (recorded here so the
next reader does not hunt for it).
