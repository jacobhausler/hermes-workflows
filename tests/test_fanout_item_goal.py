"""fb12da4 — fan-out own-goal collision guard (WARN-ONLY, no fail-closed).

Mechanism (mid-flight amend probe, reproduced on an unpatched engine): an item's own `goal` wins
over the fan-out template at the own-goal override in `one()`. A graph whose
per-item `goal` fields all carry another item's already-substituted text (the
waveA2/A3 amend shape) shipped that item's lane token to EVERY other child on
the respawned wave — proven: collision=True against the unpatched engine.

The guard, per the owner ruling: scoped to fields the fan-out template itself
declares via {item.FIELD}; an own-goal that bakes a sibling's value for a
declared field gets a loud `item.goal_drift` event and the template render is
preferred. NEVER fail-closed — there is no 'goal_mismatch' spawn-refusal
anywhere; an item whose own-goal looks collided but matches no sibling still
spawns with its verbatim own text. Graphs whose items own the payload verbatim
(template '{item.goal}', the waveA3/A4 author pattern — no declared
{item.FIELD}) never enter the path.

Second guard, same event vocabulary: a rendered goal still carrying a
placeholder that resolves to nothing — dotted '{item.X}' (fmt_goal only
interpolates bare {FIELD}) or a bare {X} naming no item key — gets a loud
one-line 'template placeholder {item.X} names no item field' warning
(`item.goal_dangling`). The 00:47:53 amend's dotted {item.lane} rewrite landed
on every wave-2 child as literal text; this makes that authoring hazard
self-diagnosing. Warn, never fail.

Runnable two ways (repo convention): `python3 tests/test_fanout_item_goal.py`
prints PASS/FAIL lines, exit 0 = green; pytest can also collect the test_*
functions directly.
