"""Docs-surface drift guard: the README's tool-action table must name exactly
the actions the door ACTUALLY dispatches, in both directions.

  * every dispatched action has a table row (a silent new action is undocumented);
  * a table row without code is an unshipped claim and must carry an
    `(open PR #NN)` tag (the doc-only direction);
  * INVERSE: a row for an action that IS dispatched must NOT carry an
    `(open PR #NN)` tag — even while that PR is open. A shipped action tagged as
    unshipped is the same lie in the other direction; the tag says "only a
    human knows whether this is real", and for a dispatched action the code
    already answered. (Reconcile est-4vnq finding 2.)

Why actual dispatch and not source text (finding 1 / R6): an earlier revision
of this pin regex-scanned `__init__.py` source for `"name": act_` pairs, so a
callable added to ACTIONS by any edit shape the regex missed stayed invisible:
a mutation adding `"probe": lambda a: True` to ACTIONS with no README row left
the old pin printing `ALL PASS: docs surface matches code` (exit 0) while the
imported door demonstrably had a 13th dispatched key. The pin must execute the
isolated door and compare ACTUAL dispatch keys. Checks 6a-6d below are the
mutation self-proof, run every time: they re-assert each direction bites, so
this pin can never again silently degrade into theater.

Shipped/unshipped tag STATES (merged? closed?) are a separate half of the same
law, audited against GitHub by scripts/pr_tag_audit.py — which now enforces
this inverse direction too, independently of this file.
