"""Core-10 exchange-run regression: the leaf verifies by RE-READING its committed
## Inputs, never from chat memory, and the file itself stays byte-portable.

The teaching pair: an echo commits a constant token (zero spawns, zero tokens); the
courier copies it as pure data from its declared input; the leaf re-reads BOTH
committed records from its own ## Inputs section and reports the verdict of a
character-for-character comparison. The save/library/replay-skip/fingerprint proofs
live in the author receipt — node prose must never ask a child to prove them, and
the leaf must never be told to assume what a committed record holds.

Regression laws asserted on the committed bytes:
- hand-off law: prepare declares inputs:["manifest.token"] and a schema that
  requires the carried token; its goal forbids exploration and demands a
  character-for-character copy.
- re-read law: verify declares inputs:["manifest","prepare"], its goal demands the
  comparison be made FROM the ## Inputs blocks (never from memory), and its schema
  teeth are {token, byte_equal, input_labels, notes} — byte_equal is required, so a
  leaf that skips the check fails contract instead of silently passing.
- run-dir legibility: the leaf's notes field carries the run-dir layout law, naming
  nodes/<id>.json, run.json and runner_exit.json as the engine's records, so a cold
  reader learns the run-dir from the file itself.
- model-naming law: no `model` field anywhere in the graph and no vendor model id
  appears in the file; children ride seat defaults (seat-fast / judge are prose
  role names only).
