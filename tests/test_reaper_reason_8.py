"""#8 (P0, remaining half): the silent-death reaper's `runner.reaped` event must
carry the OBSERVED gw-restart-window reason when the death window matches a
gateway restart.

The incident shape (issue #8): the gateway is SIGTERMed for a restart; the
enclosing unit sweep takes the runner (and its children) down with it. No exit
record exists, so the reaper says `crashed (no exit record)` — and the operator
has to correlate the death against the gateway log by hand. The fix law: the
reaper does that correlation itself, from FILES ONLY — a `Received SIGTERM`
line in <hermes_home>/logs/gateway.log whose stamp falls within +/-120 s of the
death anchor (the last event ts in events.jsonl, else the wf.pid mtime) upgrades
the reason to `crashed (no exit record); gw-restart window match`.

Never-fatal law: an absent or unreadable gateway log keeps today's bare reason,
byte-identical, and the reap still happens — visibility is diagnostics, never a
reason to skip the resume.

RED on origin/main: the match branch does not exist — S1 fails with the bare
reason. S2/S3/S4 are the no-regression pins (byte-identical bare reason).
