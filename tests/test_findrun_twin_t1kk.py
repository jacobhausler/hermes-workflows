"""est-t1kk — find_run must open the LISTED valid twin, not the torn first-root dir.

Failure mode pinned (zap cert 6033425646 sibling defect on merged #264): the
shipped realpath dedupe (est-7ps8) makes the LISTING enumerate a same-named
torn dir (resolved root) and its valid twin (legacy root) as two rows of one
id — the valid run lands in the list. But opening that LISTED id goes through
wfcommon.find_run, whose selection is "resolved root / rid unless it does not
EXIST": the torn first-root dir exists, so find_run resolves the torn path and
the dashboard's _safe_run/_view answer yields no view ({"error": "unknown
run"}). Listing says the run is there; opening it says it is not. Pre-existing
at base b413983 — NOT caused by #264.

Fixture (fresh private WF_RUNS_ROOT per invocation; inherited lane env scrubbed):
  TWIN   torn in RESOLVED (no graph.json, corrupt run.json, stray logs/),
         VALID in LEGACY            -> the listed twin find_run must open.
  KONTRA VALID in RESOLVED, torn in LEGACY -> resolved must still win.
  BOTH   valid in both roots         -> resolved must still win (no flip).
  missing never lands; find_run keeps returning the resolved path (the
  create/resume shape callers rely on).

Cases:
  (A) listing: iter_run_dirs enumerates both same-named physical dirs AND
      dashboard _list_runs reports the valid twin id exactly once.
      Passes at base (pinned by est-7ps8) — the regression pin.
  (B1) wfcommon.find_run(TWIN) resolves to the LEGACY valid twin. RED at base
       (returns the torn resolved dir).
  (B2) the dashboard open path (_safe_run -> _view, the get-run route's core)
       returns the VALID dir's view for the listed id. RED at base.
  (B3) controls at every head: KONTRA and BOTH keep the resolved-root win;
       an unknown id still answers the resolved path (exists=False).
  (C) hermetic: the exported hostile WF_RUNS_ROOT (the launcher's) stays
      empty — the scrubbing + self-pinning worked.

Run: PYTHONPATH=/opt/hermes:.. python3 tests/test_findrun_twin_t1kk.py
(from the tests/ cwd; a fresh private WF_RUNS_ROOT is created per invocation
and any inherited WF_*/HERMES_WF_* is scrubbed, so a hostile lane env cannot
steer the roots nor be written by it — the probe is read-only.)
