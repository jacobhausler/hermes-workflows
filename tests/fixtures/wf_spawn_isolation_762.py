"""est-2ek.1.762: the launch-env pin for every test that spawns `wf.py run`.

The runs-root resolver precedence (#42) is

    settings.runs_root  >  WF_RUNS_ROOT env  >  <hermes_home>/workflows

so HERMES_HOME alone is NOT a sandbox: a child that inherits the invoking
process's WF_RUNS_ROOT writes its run dir wherever the LANE was launched from.
On a production host that lane root IS the estate library — this is exactly how
774 of 1227 unique dirs under /home/hermes/.hermes/workflows ended up as
zero-log test fixtures (feedback census spool key 9cfe87a0199e5e1b, est-2ek.1.762).

The law this helper enforces (same shape as merged test_wake_hermetic_env.py
#250 and est-aywd #257): a spawned runner child must carry BOTH
    HERMES_HOME  == the test's scratch home
    WF_RUNS_ROOT == the SAME scratch root the test reads its runs from
so the two resolvers can never disagree and nothing can land outside the test.

Usage:

    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent / "fixtures"))
    from wf_spawn_isolation_762 import launch_env, pin_env

    env = launch_env(home, runs)                      # scrubbed, both pins
    env = pin_env(dict(os.environ, HERMES_HOME=...), runs)   # explicit env builder

`pin_env` returns the mapping with WF_RUNS_ROOT force-set (a stray inherited
value is REPLACED, never respected — an inherited root is the leak), and strips
API_SERVER_* so a hostile parent can't steer the child's door either.

Stdlib-only. Referenced by the static audit in tests/test_suite_runs_root_762.py.
