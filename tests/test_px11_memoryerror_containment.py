"""est-px11 / PR #122 re-review pin: decoder MemoryError must be CONTAINED.

The #111 rewrite replaced the parent scanner's `except Exception` with
`(ValueError, RecursionError)` at the raw_decode seam. The committee measured
(4/4 on 3.12.13 + 3.14.7) that json's C decoder can also raise MemoryError —
a plain Exception, neither of the two — under an RLIMIT_AS ceiling at parse
entry with an already-resident flat 1M-zero candidate + shallow trailing
{"ok":true}: head died where clean main returned {"ok": true}. The tuple now
carries MemoryError; the pre-#111 containment is restored at the seam.

Honest limits (carried from the committee): pressure-dependent regression,
end-to-end node death not deterministically reproduced through the runner.
This pin therefore runs the SAME pressure deterministically in a spawn
(fixed headroom, no mocks, unmocked decoder), and asserts the containment
property, not a race.

Run: env -u WF_RUNS_ROOT -u HERMES_HOME /opt/hermes/.venv/bin/python tests/test_px11_memoryerror_containment.py
