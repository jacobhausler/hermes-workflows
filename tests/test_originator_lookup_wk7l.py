"""est-wk7l — the originating-agent lookup must be root-normalized, root-scoped,
and never substitute another root's answer (independent-review findings at PR #156
head 992416a; runtime-proven by the committee's probe_originator.py).

Findings pinned here, one check each:
  B1  a NAMED-profile home (…/profiles/<name>) must resolve through the repo's own
      profiles_root()/hermes_root() normalizers — the raw `home/"profiles"` join
      looked INSIDE the profile and found nothing (probe: profile_scoped_scan={}).
  B2  the ROOT default profile's state.db (root/state.db) participates; a session
      owned by the root/default profile resolves instead of falling through.
  B3  the TTL cache is keyed by the NORMALIZED root: sweeping root B within root
      A's TTL returns B's map, never A's (probe: same-session stayed 'alpha' after
      switching home to estate-b).
  B4  a different root whose sweep yields NOTHING contributes nothing — the old
      map of a DIFFERENT root is never retained across it (probe: empty_home kept
      the old labels after TTL expiry).
  B5  absent/empty/foreign-schema dbs contribute no rows and never raise.

Red-proof (pre-fix head 992416a): B1-B4 all FAIL (B1 {} vs {'beta-session':'beta'},
B2 default-session absent, B3 wrong_home_attribution='alpha', B4 keeps old labels);
B5 passes pre-fix and must stay green.
