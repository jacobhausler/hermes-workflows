"""est-ja41 — the ratelimit park's attempts history must survive the transport
ladder (PR #159 finding, the REVERSE direction of the wf159c B2 pin).

The reverse-transition shape (unit, deterministic — no fake, no subprocess):

    banner death -> park respawns -> transport death -> transient ladder
    respawns -> success.

Both node.retrying events fire (park's and ladder's), so the event history
holds two deaths. Before the fix the ladder reset attempts_log to its own
bookkeeping — the committed record carried ONLY the transport death and the
parked rate-limit death was silently dropped (the finding's runner-subprocess
repro: attempts=3, attempts_log=[transport] only).

The fix (est-ja41, this pin):
  * the ladder SEEDS from r["attempts_log"] — an inherited park history is
    preserved in record order (ratelimit entry first, ladder entries after);
  * the two-death cap and the transport_exhausted demotion run on
    `ladder_attempts` (THIS ladder's own attempts). An inherited log alone
    never demotes a record the ladder never touched (A1 shape: an
    transport_exhausted laundering would also unlock the fallback ladder for
    a death that was never the ladder's);
  * the retry-sleep schedule indexes ladder_attempts, so an inherited log
    cannot shift the first ladder sleep from 5 s to 20 s (the fake's
    transport deaths are instant — this branch is law-pinned by the schedule
    code path + A4's unit below pins the counter directly).

Byte-identity law: a run that never visited the park has r["attempts_log"]
absent -> seed == [] -> attempts_log grows exactly as before, and
ladder_attempts >= 1 is exactly the old `attempts_log` non-empty condition
(both append sites bump the counter in lockstep). The golden-solo gate is the
referee.
