"""#61 — the runner is process-tree aware before it judges an attempt.

Evidence run 20260930-070100-fb-fix-3473882e (logs/suite.a0.log + suite.a1.log):
the child backgrounded the REAL work (detached pytest), printed progress chatter
("Suite is running ... Waiting for the actual exit."), exited 0; the runner judged
it no-result and BLIND-RETRIED attempt a1 into the SAME worktree while a0's
detached pytest was still executing — two full suites, one tree, mutually
corrupting caches. A false-green suite is the worst possible miss: the suite
verdict gates every merge lane. A progress string is not an exit.

Contracts proven here (RED before the fix):
 U1  /proc helpers exist: live children by ppid, live members of a process group
     (survives reparenting once the spawner is reaped), nonexistent pid = empty;
     left_live_descendants is in the closed set and in NEITHER retry ladder.
 U2  the /proc read itself: a same-session grandchild that outlives its spawner
     is still found by the pgid walk (killpg can reach it; death can be PROVED,
     and a killpg of a dead pgid proves it just as honestly).
 R-A a child that exits 0 with progress chatter and a live backgrounded
     descendant is NOT done and NOT blind-retried: exactly one spawn, failed
     error_class=left_live_descendants, error names progress-not-result + the
     fenced block, the tree killed and proven dead; the exit-judged node shape
     names the verdict law in the error (the 06f57ea9 suite-verdict-from-chatter
     repro shape).
 R-B a retry that DOES fire (Q4 transport, api_calls==0) proves the prior tree
     dead (node.tree_kill proof=dead) BEFORE the next spawn, and every prior
     descendant is dead at run end; the Q4 ladder itself is untouched.
 R-B2 an ordinary (non-backgrounding) rc!=0 transport death still re-spawns:
     isolation is a quarantine, not a blanket pre-respawn kill, and the
     dead-or-empty proof rides the respawn.
 R-C a healthy fenced-answer node is unchanged: one spawn, done, zero tree
     events, zero tree_* keys on the record (solo byte-identity law).
