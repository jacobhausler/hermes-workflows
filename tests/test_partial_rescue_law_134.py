"""The partial-rescue law (issue #134): the committed nodes/*.json done-set
parsed against the CURRENT graph is the ONLY saved recovery state. Editing the
submitted graph changes what a rerun does (amend-via-efp is the sanctioned
recovery path), and the plugin therefore carries NO rescue-snapshot file by
design — a future contributor must not "fix" recovery by adding a graph
snapshot (the DAGMan rescue-DAG pattern stores only which nodes were done and
lets the rerun follow the edited .dag; here the efp law already gives that
behavior with one less thing to keep in sync).

Pure read-model test: no runner spawn, no door call. Node records are written
directly with the efp stamps the runner would write, exactly like
test_amend_preview_defdiff does.

What each check pins:
  1. With a done record whose efp was computed against the graph ON DISK,
     node_rec reads it as done (the done-set is disk truth).
  2. Replacing graph.json with an amended graph (the os.replace act_amend does)
     in which an ANCESTOR's def changed flips the DESCENDANT's committed record
     to pending — the done-set was recomputed against the current graph, not
     any stored graph copy.
  3. amend_preview on the same amended graph agrees (will_rerun names the
     ancestor + downstream), preview and runner share one law.
  4. There is no second graph file to go stale: the run dir carries no
     graph*.json snapshot besides graph.json itself (by-design absence; if a
     rescue snapshot is ever added, this check names it).
