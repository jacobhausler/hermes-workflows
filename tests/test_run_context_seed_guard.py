"""Door-transport guard: run_context must never silently route a map to seed.

Clean-room repro: handle(action=run, run_context=json.dumps({"symptom": ...}))
— a tool-call transport that string-encodes the map — took the seed branch,
which is append-only, so the persisted graph.json kept literal {run.KEY} refs
and seats billed on unsubstituted templates. Same failure class as the merged
#7 brace-guard work on this binding surface: reject before any run write and
name the offending node/key. A seed that leaves {run.KEY} refs dangling is
broken regardless of where the string came from, so the seed branch refuses
them outright; the map branch is unchanged.
