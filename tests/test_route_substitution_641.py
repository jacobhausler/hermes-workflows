"""est-2ek.1.641 — post-admission route substitution is DENIED before submit.

Evidence (runs 20261004-070649-zap-night-est-2ek1562 / 071125 / 072517): the door
proved the pinned route ALIVE at admission (a proved-alive receipt exists for the
lane), yet a subsequent spawn for that lane billed a DIFFERENT model
(claude-opus) — the require_route gate covers the admission ping and #25's commit
hold fires only AFTER the billing happened. Nothing refuses the substitution
BEFORE the spawn.

Law pinned here (RED on base, GREEN on branch) — require_route enforcement
stays EXACTLY as is; this is an additive fail-closed lane receipt:
  B1  spawn 1 with the pinned def (proved-alive at the stub) commits done; the
      lane keeps a proved-alive receipt (run dir route_receipts.json).
  B2  a subsequent spawn for the SAME lane whose effective route differs from
      the receipt (the denied-fallback shape) is refused BEFORE submit, typed
      error_class=route_substitution_denied, and the seat stub logged ZERO
      attempts against the substituted model.
  B3  the same-model ladder respawn (same route) is NEVER denied (receipt is
      not a spawn lock).
  B4  a lane with no proved-alive receipt behaves byte-identically (no new
      gate fires).
  B5  the typed class is in the closed set ERROR_CLASSES.
  B6  require_route: false does NOT opt out of the receipt hold (fail-closed:
      the opt-out governs the admission ping, not a post-admission substitution).
Uses the repo's own in-process run_child harness (test_11_runner_profile shape)
with a recording seat stub — the stub IS the attempt ledger.
