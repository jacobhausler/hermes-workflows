"""est-g255 P255-3 (zap, HIGH) — ticket and heartbeat identity must be more
than a bare PID, and an unreadable registry must never silently undercount.

Base failures (zap independent-results.json):
  * a corrupt busy.json was RETAINED but a new cap=1 seat was admitted —
    malformed ticket rows are silently omitted from the live count
    (_seat_live_tickets `continue`s past them), so a torn/unreadable registry
    undercounts capacity instead of preserving it;
  * a ticket carrying a real local child PID plus a contradictory synthetic
    starttime=-1 counted as live, and a heartbeat naming an unrelated PID with
    ts=0 and an empty observed subtree PROVED life — PID-only identity lets a
    stale/reused pid or a synthetic row keep a seat or a silence kill alive.

Fix contract (wf.py):
  * tickets record process boot identity at acquire/bind (pid + /proc starttime
    via the existing identity-primitive shape, _proc_alive-adjacent);
    liveness must match BOTH pid and boot identity — a contradictory starttime
    is disproved, never trusted;
  * a ticket row that cannot be parsed (corrupt/unreadable) preserves
    UNCERTAIN capacity: it counts as live (never pruned, never admitted past
    cap);
  * a heartbeat proves life only with a real positive stamp (ts > 0) — an
    unproven ts=0 row proves nothing.
