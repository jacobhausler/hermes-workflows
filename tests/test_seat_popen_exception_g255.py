"""est-g255 P255-4 (zap, MED) — an exception AFTER Popen but before the polling
try/finally leaks the seat and skips child cleanup.

Base failure (zap independent-results.json / post_popen_exception_release):
fault-injecting a RuntimeError at _route_receipt_bake left one seat ticket and
one registered live child on disk — _seat_bind/_route_receipt_bake/
write_spawn_record/ledger_row all run OUTSIDE the try that owns the
finally-releasing cleanup, so anything raising there escapes with the seat
held and the child un-reaped. The independent harness had to kill/reap the
child and delete the ticket itself.

Fix contract (wf.py): ONE cleanup boundary over the whole acquired-seat/child
lifetime including post-Popen setup — any exception releases the seat,
terminates+reaps the immediate child, closes the log fd, deregisters
meta['_procs'] — then re-raises.
