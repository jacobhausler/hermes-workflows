/**
 * runtray.mjs — SKELETON for the collapsible live-run tray (#22, design
 * contract on issue #22).
 *
 * Target shape (accepted design, supersedes the #28 sticky-rail shape for
 * live runs): a collapsible situational tray stacked as a sibling of the
 * native task-list / subagents / queued-messages family directly above the
 * chat window, keyed on owner.session_id INCLUDING dispatch/cron-shaped
 * launches whose owner.session_id matches the focused chat.
 *
 *   - collapsed: ONE thicker tray row — pulse glyph ⌬, aggregate label
 *     `N runs · X building · Y held` (held amber, failed red), micro
 *     node-transition sparkline, ▾. Hidden at zero live runs; the last
 *     completion lingers 60 s as `last run done · n/n nodes`, then retracts.
 *   - expanded: one row per owned run — status chip, name + lane_key, node
 *     dots + x/y, current node, elapsed, token chip. Order held → building →
 *     queued → finished (held pinned top). Finished rows ack-away (cap 10).
 *     Row click accordion-expands the shared MiniGraph; `open ↗` escalates to
 *     the pane; click-away collapses; Esc collapses to the collapsed row.
 *
 * SKELETON LAWS (this file):
 *  - Bodies are TODO shells: importing this module must never throw and must
 *    never touch the network or persistent state (R6: no behaviour by
 *    source-text; atoms in-memory only, never localStorage).
 *  - The REAL integration today lives in desktop/plugin.js: SessionStrip is
 *    the mount owner and the tray models (trayScoping, trayModel,
 *    trayAggregateLabel, trayRecap, ackFinished, toggleTray, $trayOpen) are
 *    exported from there and exercised by tests/test_run_tray.mjs (RED-first
 *    — the scaffold PR ships them failing on purpose). This module is the
 *    component family the build lane grows those bodies into; plugin.js must
 *    stay import-clean on its own regardless (tests/test_11_ui_imports.mjs
 *    freezes plugin.js imports to exactly three sources, so plugin.js may
 *    NEVER import-reexport from this file).
 *  - Imports ride the frozen baseline only: @hermes/plugin-sdk, react,
 *    react/jsx-runtime — zero new sources. The shells below import NOTHING so
 *    the file also parses/loads clean under plain node until the build lane
 *    grows real bodies (the moment jsx is needed it comes from
 *    react/jsx-runtime, the repo's baseline).
 *
 * STATUS (build lane, #22): the REAL implementation landed IN PLACE in
 * desktop/plugin.js — trayScoping/trayModel/trayAggregateLabel/trayRecap/
 * trayShouldShow/ackFinished/toggleTray + RunTrayRow/RunTrayRunRow/RunTray
 * are exported there (test_11_ui_imports freezes plugin.js imports at the
 * three SDK sources, so plugin.js may never import-reexport from this file).
 * The shells below are kept as DESIGN DOCUMENTATION only: the contract
 * tests/test_run_tray.mjs asserts, in shell shape. They throw on call so any
 * accidental live use is loud, never silently divergent.
 */

/**
 * Pure model shells. Mirrors the contract tests/test_run_tray.mjs asserts —
 * the build lane ports these to desktop/plugin.js (or re-exports the real
 * implementations from there); until then they throw to make any accidental
 * live use loud instead of silently wrong.
