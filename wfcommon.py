# ---------- #85: artifact-admission guard — input ledgers map 1:1 to sources ----------
# The class (WOFS W1f evidence-loss, cluster spool aaca9fe5a15f5f2b): a fan-out item
# consumed an artifact another item's source actually covered — a disposition ledger
# had silently lost 85/95 rationales and nothing at admission could tell the runner.
# `fanout.ledger` is the ITEM-INDEXED input ledger: one row per item, positionally
# aligned; a row is a plain '<node_id>.<dotted.path>' input-ref string or
# {"source": "<node_id>.<dotted.path>", "artifact": {"file": rel/path, "sha256"?}}
# naming the on-disk artifact the item will consume. This guard runs at the door
# BEFORE any write/spawn and refuses, fail-closed, unless rows map 1:1 to items:
#   * a row without an item ("row N has no item"), or an item (by position) whose
#     row is absent ("item N is missing ledger source ...");
#   * two items sharing one source (sources are consumed at most once);
#   * a source head outside the node's transitive `after` ancestry (same data-edge
#     law as `inputs` refs — only committed upstream outputs may feed the fan-out);
#   * a declared artifact whose run-dir file is absent or whose sha256 disagrees
#     (measured ONLY when run_dir is given — run creation has no run dir yet;
#     amend/validate-with-dir measure the bytes).
# Graphs WITHOUT a ledger declaration are byte-unchanged (no ledger, no guard;
# golden-solo EMPTY-diff law). Row CONTAINER shape (non-list ledger) is a
# validator defect; everything else about a row is measured here, so the RED
# graph (an item with no ledger row) stays VALIDATOR-CLEAN and can only be
# refused by this guard — that split is pinned by tests/test_admission_ledger_85.py.

# `include: [{as, use, seeds, exports}]` annotation expands to a plain wf/1 graph
# BEFORE validation/persistence. The runner, read model, gates and desktop never
# learn includes exist; the closed-set node validator is untouched (include is not
# a node kind — it is a graph-level annotation like `grammar`, :564-568). The door
# owns the call sites (run/amend/save, before _validation_error) and supplies
# library_reader(name) -> dict|None (the same resolver `from=<name>` uses); this
# module must never import the door.
#
# Invariants this pass is built to keep:
#   * deterministic namespacing: id -> `<alias>__<inner-id>` (double underscore,
#     never a dot — ids double as nodes/<id>.json basenames and `out.<id>` syntax),
#     length-checked against ID_OK's 64-char cap: on overflow REFUSE, never truncate.
#   * five id-ref surfaces rewritten in lockstep inside the subtree: after, inputs
#     heads, requires keys, fanout.items_from head AND its after entry (the
#     items_from head must remain a direct after parent, :914-920), and `when`
#     out.<id>. paths. `when` heads are NOT existence-checked by the validator
#     (:1298-1309 parses structure only), so this pass validates them against the
#     namespace-local id set itself — a missed rewrite is a silent gate-fire failure.
#   * seed contract: include `seeds` render {run.KEY} INSIDE the included subtree
#     ONLY; an unbound reference there is the #69 fail-closed refusal (the message
#     names the alias). Parent {run.X} text is never touched by child seeds.
#   * strip-on-expand: the returned graph has NO `include` key (golden-solo byte
#     pins; a committed graph.json carrying `include` is by definition unexpanded).
#   * efp stability: parent nodes not wired to an include stay byte-identical —
#     def_hash/efp/replay-skip are untouched by construction; only rewired nodes
#     move, which is precisely the intended re-run granularity.
# Constants here MIRROR the door's (GRAPH_MAX_BYTES __init__.py:39); the door owns
