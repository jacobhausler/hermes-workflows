# Portable workflow files (publish = put the file on git)

There is no index, service, or marketplace: a workflow is published when someone commits the file to a repo and shares the path. The convention:

1. One graph per file, named `<name>.workflow.json` — plain UTF-8 JSON, a regular file of at most 1 MiB with no final symlink, holding the same `{name, nodes, …}` object the `workflow` tool's `run` action accepts inline.
2. State the dialect at the top: `"grammar": "wf/1"`. Absent means `wf/1` (every file written before the tag existed is a `wf/1` file); a value this reader does not know is refused before any write or spawn, with the supported list in the error — a newer dialect is never misrun.
3. Add a `provenance` block (encouraged, optional): `owner` (who maintains it), `source` (where the canonical copy lives, ≤ 200 chars), `source_digest` (sha256 of the canonical `nodes` JSON — `wfcommon.source_digest(graph)`). Attribution only; nothing reads it to allow or deny.
4. Drop the file anywhere on disk and run it: `workflow{action:"run", graph_path:"/abs/path/<name>.workflow.json"}`; `save` with `graph_path` shelves it in the library for `run from:<name>`.
5. Keep it self-contained: no absolute paths of your machine, no secrets, no profile names — `{run.KEY}` inputs and `profile` are the receiver's to bind. A file that uses the graph-level `include` key (shipped in v1.3.0) is not portable as published: the aliases name graphs in the author's own library, which the receiver does not have. Inline the included graphs (or publish them alongside as their own portable files and say so) before sharing.
6. Budgets (`max_turns`, `timeout`, `shape`) travel with the file but are policy, not work: a receiver may raise them without changing any node's fingerprint.
7. Pin what you publish: record the file's sha256 next to the link so a reader can check `sha256sum <file>` before running it.
8. A `wf/1` file carries NO code. Nodes are goals, schemas, edges and gates; every action is performed by the receiver's own Hermes with the receiver's own tools and consent. Contrast Anthropic-style `.js` workflow files, which DO carry executable code — that is the dialect line, and the reason `grammar` exists.
9. Validate before sharing: `python3 -c 'import json,wfcommon; print(wfcommon.validate_graph_errors(json.load(open("<file>"))))'` from the plugin root must print `[]`.
10. `grammar` and `provenance` are top-level annotations: they never enter `def_hash`, the effective fingerprint (`efp`), `graph_fingerprint` or `source_digest`, so adding them to an existing file changes no committed node.

## Walk-in example

`examples/review/portable-review.workflow.json` — recon → two-way fan-out review → summary, `grammar: "wf/1"` with a provenance block. Supply `run_context: {"target_dir": "/abs/path/to/files-to-review"}`; the target must contain at least two readable files. Pinned:

- file sha256 (`sha256sum examples/review/portable-review.workflow.json`): `f57677e344ea051b2f087a5673319c6865d8b863e2dd5d73bcf921b493b00483`
- `source_digest` (canonical `nodes` JSON): `d3c024d89563d84cf8af104752e22741350533a1977b843f382a51aeee436634`

`tests/test_portable_32.py` asserts the example validates and that both digests still match this page; editing the example means re-pinning here in the same commit.
