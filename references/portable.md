# Portable workflow files (publish = put the file on git)

There is no index, service, or marketplace: a workflow is published when someone commits the file to a repo and shares the path. The convention, in ten lines:

1. One graph per file, named `<name>.workflow.json` — plain UTF-8 JSON, ≤ 1 MiB, the same `{name, nodes, …}` object `run` accepts inline.
2. State the dialect at the top: `"grammar": "wf/1"`. Absent means `wf/1` (every pre-#32 file is a `wf/1` file); a value this reader does not know is refused before any write or spawn, with the supported list in the error — a newer dialect is never misrun.
3. Add a `provenance` block (encouraged, optional): `owner` (who maintains it), `source` (where the canonical copy lives, ≤ 200 chars), `source_digest` (sha256 of the canonical `nodes` JSON — `wfcommon.source_digest(graph)`). Attribution only; nothing reads it to allow or deny.
4. Drop the file anywhere on disk and run it: `workflow{action:"run", graph_path:"/abs/path/<name>.workflow.json"}`; `save` with `graph_path` shelves it in the library for `run from:<name>`.
5. Keep it self-contained: no absolute paths of your machine, no secrets, no profile names — `{run.KEY}` inputs and `profile` are the receiver's to bind.
6. Budgets (`max_turns`, `timeout`, `shape`) travel with the file but are policy, not work: a receiver may raise them without changing any node's fingerprint.
7. Pin what you publish: record the file's sha256 next to the link so a reader can check `sha256sum <file>` before running it.
8. A `wf/1` file carries NO code. Nodes are goals, schemas, edges and gates; every action is performed by the receiver's own Hermes with the receiver's own tools and consent. Contrast Anthropic-style `.js` workflow files, which DO carry executable code — that is the dialect line, and the reason `grammar` exists.
9. Validate before sharing: `python3 -c 'import json,wfcommon; print(wfcommon.validate_graph_errors(json.load(open("<file>"))))'` from the plugin root must print `[]`.
10. `grammar` and `provenance` are top-level annotations: they never enter `def_hash`, `efp`, `graph_fingerprint` or `source_digest`, so adding them to an existing file changes no committed node.

## Walk-in example

`examples/portable-review.workflow.json` — recon → two-way fan-out review → summary, `grammar: "wf/1"` with a provenance block. Pinned:

- file sha256 (`sha256sum examples/portable-review.workflow.json`): `5111407e02f483b249bef292eec79f4aa8b760caf60a9b6f725c4a4c471c7b62`
- `source_digest` (canonical `nodes` JSON): `a4961c82014e102debfe254a3f022e958edc8c8a69da8df81be9b16341bf26b1`

`tests/test_portable_32.py` asserts the example validates and that both digests still match this page; editing the example means re-pinning here in the same commit.

## The js dialect seam (#33): `wf_dialect.py`

Anthropic-style `.claude/workflows/<name>.js` files are the other dialect of the same shape-space ([dialect](dialect.md) is the mapping ledger; `tests/fixtures/dialect/` is its executable form). `wf_dialect.py` is a standalone stdlib module at the plugin root — deliberately NOT a `workflow` tool action: interop is an authoring-time file conversion, and the door's closed action set stays as it is. Two commands, run from the plugin root:

- Import: `python3 wf_dialect.py import <script.js>` prints `{"ok": true, "graph": {…wf/1…}, "warnings": […]}` (exit 0) or `{"ok": false, "refuse": "<construct> at line N"}` (exit 1). Only the [§3 subset](dialect.md#3-the-importable-subset-stated-once) imports: literal `meta`, sequential `const x = await agent(template, {schema, label, model, phase})`, a static `parallel([...])` of agent calls/thunks, `pipeline(<const>.<field> | [literal], stage…)` with every stage a direct `agent(...)`, `phase()`/`log()` literals (dropped, reported), a bare `return <const>` or `return <pipeline>.filter(Boolean)`. Everything else is refused with the construct and its line named — never approximated. Save the `graph` to `<name>.workflow.json` and run it with `graph_path`.
- Export: `python3 wf_dialect.py export <graph.json> [--name N] [--out <dir>/<name>.js]` writes their shape (static `meta`, `await agent(...)` in wave order, `parallel([...])` for a static fan-out, `pipeline(...)` for `items_from` and chained fan-outs, `{run.KEY}` → `${args.KEY}`, `phase('Wave n')` from `after` depth). `--out` never creates the directory. Output is byte-stable for equal input.

Lossy-export warning rule: every wf/1 key with no counterpart on their side — `requires`, `hold_timeout`, `on_skip`, `profile`, `toolsets`, `repo`, `provider`, `max_turns`/`timeout`/`run_budget`/`shape`, `reasoning`, `require_route`, `model_policy`, extra `defaults` — is emitted as a `// LOSSY: <key> = <value>` comment line AT the node and listed again in the header `// LOSSY SUMMARY`, and printed once per key on stderr; nothing is dropped silently. A human gate becomes a `// HOLD: <question> [options]` stub whose const carries `default_option`. A graph whose semantics have no representation at all is REFUSED by name, mirroring the importer: a fan-out `quorum` (race), a human gate with no `default_option`, a `when` gate that prunes descendants, an `inputs` ref inside a fan-out's `{items, all_results}` object other than `.items`. The optional `node --check` syntax gate runs when `node` is on PATH; when it is absent the result carries `node_check: skipped` plus one warning and the importer's own scanner is the only gate (never a crash). Library use: `import wf_dialect; wf_dialect.js_import(source)` / `wf_dialect.export_report(graph)` (`js_export` raises `DialectRefusal`).
