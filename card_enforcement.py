"""#157 MACHINERY (backend half): card enforcement — the ::workflow card ships unasked.

core fires the ``transform_llm_output`` lifecycle hook once per turn BEFORE the
final assistant row is persisted (core: hermes_cli/plugins.py VALID_HOOKS;
agent/turn_finalizer.py apply_llm_output_transform — the first hook returning a
non-empty string wins and that string becomes the persisted+streamed text). This
module is the last-resort shipper: when a turn's text carries NO parseable
``::workflow{id="<run_id>"}`` directive, the cards for runs THIS session launched
inside the recency window are appended as bare lines, so the desktop directive
renderer (desktop/plugin.js DirectiveCard) renders even when the model never
pastes. The model's paste stays the primary path — this hook only fills silence.

Design notes:
* ONE-SHOT LEDGER (zero new files): a run's card counts as shipped when its
  events.jsonl carries a ``card.echoed`` marker (appended on CONFIRMATION,
  below; a failed write costs only a re-ship next turn, never a lost turn).
  run.json stays byte-identical.
* SHIPPED MEANS SELECTED (#168 P1): core's dispatch (plugins_dispatch.invoke_hook)
  fires EVERY transform_llm_output callback and apply_llm_output_transform keeps
  the FIRST non-empty string — so a return value is a HOPE, not a shipment.
  A proposal is therefore recorded in-memory (_PENDING) and the card.echoed
  marker is written only on CONFIRMATION that the text was selected:
  (1) the returned text is touched — core truth-tests each result at selection
      time (isinstance + bool) and str-manipulates the winner, so any attribute
      access or bool coercion of our return proves delivery;
  (2) at the session's next hook call, a still-referenced proposal text is
      treated as the persisted winner (a discarded text dies with the dispatch
      results list);
  (3) an optional module-level ``_witness`` callable (test seam / durable-row
      probe) vouches for the committed row directly and suppresses (1).
  An unconfirmed proposal is simply dropped — the card replays next turn
  instead of being silently lost. A second proposal for the SAME (session,
  turn) can never win (first non-empty already holds) and returns None.
* PASTE RETIREMENT (#168 P2): a bare directive seen in this session's turn text
  retires that run's owed card PER RUN (a sibling run's card is untouched),
  even when the directive arrived through a different route (model paste);
  a fenced/inline-code directive is dead text and retires nothing.
* FENCE TRAP (#168 P3): appending into a text that ends INSIDE an open ```
  fence buries the card renderer-dead while the ledger says shipped — the
  append closes the open fence first so the card always lands outside every
  fence, as the final lines of the text.
* RECOGNITION parity with the directive renderer: the exact form
  ``::workflow{id="<run_id>"}`` with run_id matching [A-Za-z0-9._-]+, OUTSIDE any
  ``` fence or `inline code` span — a code-blocked directive is dead text to the
  renderer, so it does NOT count as shipped (the paste hint says the same).
* FAIL-OPEN: every path is guarded; any exception means "ship nothing, change
  nothing". A broken ledger must never eat the user's reply.
* The unknown surface (falsy platform) is never guessed: no surface, no append.

Path resolution is NOT reimplemented: the door injects its bound wfcommon
instance via bind() and every root comes from the existing resolvers
(runs_root / profiles_root+profile_home / launch_runs_root legacy).
