# ---------- #8 item 3: crash-respawn idempotence (attempt-N preamble +
# reconcile-don't-redo) ----------
# The incident-class-split comment on #8 keeps item 3 open: a respawned runner
# (the reaper's revival of a dead one) re-drives pending nodes BLIND over the
# side effects the dead attempt already executed — the firehose shape: the
# respawned build lane pushes the branch / opens the PR a second time. Three
# engine facts close it:
#   (a) an attempt-N PREAMBLE RECORD at the respawn boot (`runner.attempt_preamble`):
#       which attempt this runner is, what non-terminal spawn records the dead
#       runner left, what the journal said — the respawn is never anonymous.
#   (b) the committed side-effect journal (<run>/side_effects.jsonl, rows appended
#       by registrants through the spawn-time env pin HERMES_WF_EFFECTS_FILE — the
#       SIDECAR-pin law) is RECONCILED against the current graph at that boot:
#       a row is a fact iff its node still exists under the current definitions
#       (an amend orphans it, same law as node_rec's efp check); torn lines
#       (a writer mid-append when the runner died) are skipped, never facts,
#       never a crash. The verdict is durable (side_effects.reconcile.json) and
#       logged (`run.respawn_reconcile`).
#   (c) reconcile-don't-redo: every spawn after a reconcile carries the
#       VALID committed-effect inventory for ITS node as a machine preamble
#       (prompt-side only, def-hash neutral, "" when nothing is committed —
#       first attempts stay byte-identical), so a re-driven child reconciles
#       against what already landed instead of redoing it.

    deterministic identity — sha256(run|event|discriminant) over ledger-backed
    facts, computed BEFORE any endpoint is touched — so a retry of the SAME
    decision reuses the instance while every genuinely new decision — gate A→B→A,
    FAILED→DONE→FAILED→DONE, a later catchable crash — mints a fresh one. The POST
    carries that identity as Idempotency-Key. At the pinned-core route, the measured
    in-window retry replays one started/completed owner turn; this is not a timeless
    dedupe claim across cache eviction, core restart, or an unmeasured delay.
    Each ATTEMPT records in <run>/wake.jsonl (the probe); a duplicate of a
    DELIVERED instance writes nothing. AUTHORITY LAW (r5): this function takes no
    text parameter at all. The owner-facing content is generated here from
    _WAKE_TEMPLATES via _wake_owner_text(run.name, event) — an event outside the
    finite map gets NO wake (silent return), so no call site can route ad-hoc or
    graph-authored prose into the owner's instruction channel. The wake.jsonl row
    and the wire body carry that same safe runner-authored string, bearer-redacted
    as a second net; the full failure detail stays in events.jsonl,
    runner_exit.json and the probe's typed error fields. Delivery failure is loud
    in the probe and NEVER raises into the run loop — the run's own state was
    already decided; a dead endpoint must not cost the run its exit. Nothing
    caller-computed is interpolated into the probe before the generic fail-open
    net; a crash in preparation records a typed line. Every persisted field is

# the CURRENT agent-node child alive in its own session, still mutating real state
# unsupervised. Every spawn already owns its process group (start_new_session=True
# at Popen == os.setsid at spawn), so the kill channel exists on every path — what
# was missing is a channel that FIRES when the runner dies:
#   (1) runner side: _runner_term_cleanup() killpgs every registered child
#       (SIGTERM grace -> SIGKILL) and sweeps subreaper-adopted escapees; it is
#       wired to EVERY exit path — normal end, node-failure bail, atexit, and a
#       SIGTERM handler that cleans and then re-raises the DEFAULT (exit code
#       and signal semantics unchanged for the door's reaper);
#   (2) child side (belt-braces, cooperative contract like the #61c registry):
#       the spawn pins the runner pid into the child env (RUNNER_PID_ENV); a
#       spawned child that follows the contract calls child_parent_watch() and
#       self-exits non-zero once its runner is verifiably dead — BUT a 790c6ad

#       the belt must never eat an adoptable orphan (adoption is law).

# leaves a grandchild whose PPid is 1 and whose PGID belongs to a dead

# is ever trusted:
#  (a) subreaper adoption (PRIMARY, needs no child cooperation):
#      PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER on the runner makes every orphan in its subtree
#      reparent to the RUNNER instead of init, so when the intermediary dies
#      the escapee sits at PPid=<runner> until it dies — enumerable at

#      spawn seam pins (registry path, unique spawn token) into the child env;
#      a detached descendant that follows the contract registers itself against
#      the token at background time, fsync'd, before its long work. The token
#      is inherited across double-fork+setsid, so a survivor still says which
#      spawn it belongs to after PPid stops telling the truth.
# Attribution of an adopted orphan uses the SAME token: /proc/PID/environ is
# readable to a same-UID probe, and a foreign-UID probe that cannot read it
# honestly loses only the token half (the registered rows still cover it).

    too). A credential-window 429 outlasts the 5s/20s transport ladder by
    orders of magnitude (field repro: a 36+ min window, ladder spent in
    ~10 s), so instead of respawning at once the runner parks ~5 min
    (jittered +/-20% by default) and re-spawns under the node's wall law.

    wf159c finding 1 — the wall is now actually a bound:
      * the fit check consumes the WORST-CASE jittered wait, interval *
        (1 + jitter_fraction), never the unjittered interval; AND
      * the park may only fire when a real respawn window still fits after
        the wait — window = max(0.25 s, 15% of the wall). Buying a wait that
        leaves no room to answer is a fake retry: refuse and give up typed.

      * the parked respawn (and every later spawn this node makes, via the

        keyed by (node id, index) so concurrent nodes/items keep their own
        budgets and run.json stays untouched.
    Every park emits `<ev>.retrying` with error_class=ratelimit and
    backoff_s (the machine-wait event shape). On give-up — budget can no
    longer fit a park, stop/cancel set, or the retry budget (meta
    _retries_left, shared with the other ladders) exhausted — the node fails

    ONCE per declared `fallback_models` entry, IN ORDER, before the run blocks.
    Gates, all tested in tests/test_plugin_asks_164_fallback.py:
      * ONLY the transport_exhausted verdict enters (the caller invokes this
        right after _transient_retry; every other class never reaches a rung —
        the quota-class 429 dies at ONE attempt, #24 law intact);
      * no key / empty key => byte-identical old behavior (zero extra spawns);
      * every rung is ONE spawn, never ladder recursion: a dead rung does NOT
        re-run Q4 on the new model;
      * each rung consumes the run's shared retry budget (the same
        meta['_retries_left'] Q4 draws from) — an exhausted budget stops the
        walk with the transport_exhausted record intact, so billing is bounded;
      * #61 quarantine law holds here too: _isolate_prior must PROVE the prior
        tree dead before a rung spawns, else fail closed typed;
      * stop / cancel kills the walk instantly (a stopped run keeps its
        cancelled-demoted record, not a half-walked ladder);
      * the first answering rung commits, stamped `fallback_model_used`, one
        node.fallback event per rung tried (named), attempts_log extended.
    Absent key stays UNTOUCHED — the golden-solo byte-identity gate is the
    referee. respawn_fallback(model) is the caller-owned one-spawn closure on
    that model (fresh skey, fresh session, like every retry respawn)."""
