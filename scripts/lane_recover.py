"""Rebuild a dead lane's working tree from its journaled tool calls (#37).

A build lane that wipes its own uncommitted work (a base checkout over a dirty
tree for a RED run) or dies at the turn cap with an unbanked tree still leaves
one durable trace: every tool call it made is journaled in the profile's
`state.db` (sessions row keyed by the runner's session key, messages in order).
This replays the write_file / patch calls into a restore dir so the recovery is
one command instead of a hand replay. Stdlib only (sqlite3, argparse); the db
is opened READ-ONLY (`mode=ro`) and never mutated.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/lane_recover.py --profile <name> --skey <session-key> [--out <restore-dir>]
  python3 scripts/lane_recover.py --run <run-id> [--node <id>] [--index <i>] [--attempt <n>] [--out <restore-dir>]

The session key is what the runner writes into the spawn record / node record
(`nodes/<node>[.<i>].json` -> `skey`): `wf:<run>:<node>[:<i>]:<efp8>.<nonce>`;
the child's sessions row carries `<skey>#a<attempt>` as its title. `--skey`
accepts either form (a bare key resolves to its latest attempt unless
`--attempt` is given). `--run` reads the key from the run dir instead (the run
dir resolves the way the read model does: `WF_RUNS_ROOT`, else
`$HERMES_HOME/workflows`; the db home is the node's own child home for
profile-routed nodes, else the launcher's).

Default mode (no --out): the triage view — the ordered call list
(index, tool, target path; `[REFUSED]` when the live tool answered with an
error). With --out: emit `<out>/<relpath>` for each touched file (write_file
replays the content; patch applies old_string -> new_string to the
accumulated text — exact first, then whitespace-flexible) and write
`<out>/lane_recover_report.json`: `written`, `applied`, `unmatched` (anchor not
found / no path / arguments not JSON), `skipped` (the joined role='tool' result
carried an error — a refused write is not a write — or the anchor is ambiguous
without replace_all, the same refusal core `patch` makes), `unconfirmed` (no
result row at all: replayed, flagged).

Exit codes: 0 recovered > 0 (or a non-empty triage list), 2 no session / no
db / db locked by a live writer, 3 no journaled write_file/patch calls.

# ---------- est-2ek.1.718: crashed-no-exit watchdog (respawn on sight, once) ----------
# The crashed-no-exit signature (dead pid + absent runner_exit.json + unfinished
# node claims) is unambiguous: the watchdog respawns WITHOUT waiting for an owner
# wait call — exactly once per run fingerprint (guard file) — and appends one
# `runner_respawn` event as receipt. A VALID recorded exit is a verdict, never a
# crash. Three hard laws (zap review on #237):
#   * RECEIPT ON CONFIRMED SPAWN ONLY: the door's act_wait answer is propagated —
#     an error / unproven liveness writes NO receipt and NO guard, so retries
#     stay open. Confirmation reads the ONE liveness law back (HELD flock =>
#     live, else /proc pid identity); a spawn is never trusted by receipt alone.
#   * SERIALIZED ADMISSION: an exclusive flock is held across guard-check +
#     spawn + receipt + guard write; atomic replace alone is not exactly-once.
#   * THE ONE VALIDITY RULE: when wfcommon is importable, unfinished work is
#     read through wfcommon.node_rec (stale efp after an amend == pending,
#     cancelled == pending), and for fan-out nodes the AGGREGATE record is the
#     commit — committed item records never mask a missing aggregate. The
#     raw-status stdlib branch is the documented WEAKER fallback for when
#     wfcommon is unimportable.
