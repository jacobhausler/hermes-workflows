"""Serial bounded suite with durable per-case logs and atomic exit ledger.

The ledger resets per run: exits.json reports the CURRENT pass only.

Pass-gate admission contract (#17): with --baseline <exits.json> (a prior run's
ledger, e.g. the clean base SHA), the run additionally writes admission.json
next to exits.json carrying the EXACT red identities (test name + exit code)
split into introduced vs pre-existing, plus fixed reds. The gate never waives
anything: only a fully-green integrated SHA (zero reds, base or fix) is green
and exits 0; pre-existing reds land in blocking_base_reds for a linked fix
item, never hand-carried. Without --baseline every red is reported as
introduced (there is no evidence it pre-existed).

Zero-discovery is a failed admission (#112): an empty tests/ dir that
discovers no cases is not a pass — the run writes exits.json == [] and
admission.json green:false + zero_discovery:true and exits nonzero, so a
suite that ran nothing can never report green. An invalid root (missing
root or missing tests directory) fails closed as exit 2 BEFORE any out-dir
side effects, leaving no ledger or admission behind.
